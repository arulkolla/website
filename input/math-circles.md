Math circles have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember; I have been attending the [UCLA Math Circle](https://circles.math.ucla.edu/circles/) for the past 10 years, where I immersed myself in creative problem solving. Later, I wanted to share my experiences with others, so I started a UCLA Math Circle Satellite Program at my local elementary school in 7th grade called the [Highland Oaks Math Circle](https://arcadiamathcircles.weebly.com/).

During the summer of 2020, I started the [Pascal Math Circle](https://pascal-math-circle.web.app/pascal.html) (for APTA) and the [Dana Math Circle](https://dana-math-circle.web.app/) (for my local middle school) to continue sharing my knowledge. Most recently, I started a Math Kangaroo Training Camp for APTA.
