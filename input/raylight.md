Here is the link to my math contest [Raylight](https://raylight.weebly.com/).

Raylight is an elementary school competition heavily emphasizing creative problem-solving skills through which students are often exposed to these types of problems for the first time. Intended to be a gentle introudction to creative problem-solving, this contest allows students to get a feel for these types of problems before delving into more challenging topics. Through the funds collected from this competition, I have given back over $\$150$ to my local community to help students in need of education.
