Here's [Laur - Sound Chimera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou_udndPAO4).

An infamous osu! song, I used to think it was only really made to have insanely fast streams. But then I listened to it again, and something about the way everything didn't fit together just made it feel right.

I guess you could say I'm a sucker for sudden chops in songs; most of my favorites, I've noticed, are filled with occasional chops. I love the way it feels like the song is constantly evolving and never really staying in one place for too long, and the sudden break to the melodic flow of music provides some contrast to the relatively smooth nature of everything else. It's kind of like crispiness or crunchiness in foods: it provides a nice contrast to the smoothness, and makes everything more interesting.[^1]

It's also got a great beat and is just generally a fun song to listen to, surprisingly (I am not typically one for "gritty-style" drops like Sound Chimera has). But the exquisiteness of the song overall just really makes me enjoy it a lot, as well as the continually high-energy drops.

Plus, Indian vocals. Yay!
