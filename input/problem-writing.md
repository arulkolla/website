As part of the Gamifying Eduation Initiative, I have written several problems for international competitions including Codeforces and Math Kangaroo with over 100,000+ impressions from contestants all across the world. Through these, I hope to make my largest impact on the world of creative problem-solving by sharing these new and unique ideas with people from all over the world. The unique almost aptitude-test-like problems are a great way to test one's creative problem-solving skills and foster a sense of competiton among students.
