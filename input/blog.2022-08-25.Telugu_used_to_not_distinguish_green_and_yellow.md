#### *And Japanese traffic lights*

Today I found out that traffic lights in Japan have red, yellow, and blue, because Japan used a single word for grue (both blue and green).[^1]

I had known blue-green nondistinction exists, but didn't know a language as big as Japaense had it. I ended up Googling it, and found out that in fact, a language I had known for quite a long time has an even stranger distinction: Telugu uses the same word పచ్చ \[pat͡ʃt͡ʃa\] (paccha) for green and yellow, and modern Telugu uses ఆకుపచ్చ (literally leaf-paccha) for green and పసుపుపచ్చ (literally turmeric-paccha) for yellow. I had known these words for over fifteen years at this point, but didn't realize this; I supposed పచ్చ was just a strange word for "color" that was only used for yellow and green.[^2]

The more you know.

[^1]: Actually, it only had words for red, blue, white, and black; the modern word for green (みどり, midori) originates from "sprout".

[^2]: This isn't entirely unfounded: బూడిదరంగు \[buːɖidaraŋu\] is "grey", but is literally బూడిద + రంగు "grey-color".
