## Hi!

I'm Arul Kolla, a high school senior attending Flintridge Preparatory School. I love math and computer science, and have a passion for sharing awareness of these creative problem-solving skills with elementary and middle school students through my project [Gamifying Education](/gamifying.html).

My academic interests typically tend to center around combinatorial algorithms, including combinatorial game theory, graph theory and data structures & algorithms. In addition, I'm also actively interested in computational linguistics (and linguistics in general). I also love sharing my passions with others.

Outside of academics, I enjoy board games, doing competitive programming, taking part in puzzle hunts, conlanging, writing problems (for both math contests and competitive programming), and neography.

My email is `arulkolla (at) gmail (dot) com`. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/arulkolla/ "GitHub").
