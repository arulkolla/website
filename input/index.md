## Welcome to Poole

In Poole you write your pages in [markdown][md]. It's easier to write
markdown than HTML.

Poole is made for simple websites you just want to get done, without installing
a bunch of requirements and without learning a template engine.

In a build, Poole copies every file from the *input* directory to the *output*
directory. During that process every markdown file (ending with *md*, *mkd*,
*mdown* or *markdown*) is converted to HTML using the project's `page.html`
as a skeleton.

Also, here is some $\LaTeX$: $\sum_{i=1}^{100} i = 5050$.
