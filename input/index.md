## hi!

I'm Arul Kolla, a high school junior attending Flintridge Preparatory School.

My interests academically typically tend to center around combinatorial algorithms, including but not limited to: combinatorial game theory, graph theory and data structures & algorithms. In addition, I'm also actively interested in computational linguistics (and linguistics in general). I also love sharing my passions with others.

Outside of academics, I enjoy board games, doing competitive programming, taking part in puzzle hunts, conlanging, writing problems (for both math contests and competitive programming), and neography.

My email is `arulkolla (at) gmail (dot) com`. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/arulkolla/ "GitHub").
