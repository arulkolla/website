Recently, using the money I fundraised through the Gamifying Education project,
- I donated $\$1000$ to the APTA Student Education Program, a program that supports underpriveleged students in need of an education.
- I donated $\$200$ to the [Institute for Educational Advancement](https://educationaladvancement.org/), a non-profit organization that provides education to gifted students.
