## Gamifying Education: A Manifesto

### The Problem-Solving-Pure-Concept Gap

The way math is traditionally taught is fundamentally flawed. Traditional math curriculi focuses heavily on new *concepts*, which are definitely important to start out with, but this abandonment of problem-solving leads to serious fundamental gaps in students' knowledge when it comes to more high-level concepts. More often than not, students seek to *drill* ideas into their head, which inevitable make the gap between "applying concepts" and "solving a problem" larger and larger. 

This gap is exemplified by what school math often tests. The vast majority, if not all, school math tests and homework are just trying to get students to solve *one sort of problem*. If they just learn addition, they are presented with a homework sheet containing twenty addition problems. Once they learn to find the slope-intercept form of a line, that same week their test is filled with twenty $y=mx+b$s.

And sure, this is *okay* when starting out. But it's important, even then, to introduce the idea that learning a topic isn't *just* to learn that topic; it's to both learn that topic and then apply it to situations. Students never realize this, of course, because how could they? All they've been taught their entire life was that going to math class followed the same monotonous cycle: learn a topic, do $n$ problems on that topic, get tested on an $(n+1)$th problem, rinse and repeat. Students can't know that math doesn't have to be this way, because they've never learned otherwise.

The way that math is taught in schools is — ironically enough — too formulaic.

Yes, math does occassionally have to be drilled. There isn't a way to learn integration without knowing addition first. But that doesn't mean everything has to be that way. The English alphabet was drilled into your head through pure repitition. Does that mean you were practicing grammar drills daily until twelfth grade?

Math needs to, at the very least, have the problem-solving aspect brought in very early, and slowly trickled in throughout one's schooling, because math is more than just numbers doing funny things; it's a way of thinking, a way to discretely analyze a situation, process it, and come to a possible method for solving it.

### Emphasis On the Possible

You may have noticed the word "possible" in the previous line; this is no accident. Too much of the emphasis on math nowadays is placed on getting the "correct" answer. Not enough emphasis, by contrast, is being placed on solution ideas, whether wrong or right. This is in part due to the rigorous cycle mentioned above, which leads no room for "possible" approaches; everything is black-and-white, and nothing is up for debate. This general sentiment is reflected throughout modern student society, as the boatload of memes about "not following the teacher's method" can testify. 

By making problems with more than one solution, more than one approach to get to the final answer, you not only open up students' creativity and curiosity but also foster a healthier learning environment; although the answers might not always be right, the fact that a whole solution is presented can give clearer insight and facilitate meaningful discussions.

Students often feel "dumb" in math classrooms when they can't come up with the answer. Again, this is not the fault of the student; the system has told them that this is how this subject must be taught. With them learning to present their solutions since a young age, they will be able to work out their mistakes *in a much more effective way than just drills*, because they have a much more verbose vocabulary to describe their process; as such, it is much easier for them to trace out their mistakes.
