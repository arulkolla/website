Around two months ago I saw the following video on alexlion0511's YouTube[^1] Channel.

Called "Wenomachainsama", one of the most intriguing titles of any video I'd seen, it turned out to just be some meme I didn't get. *E*xcept, this meme was linguistic; in particular, it was an English-to-phonetic mondegreen. That is, speakers were "mishearing"[^2] the lyrics to Calvin Harris' *Summer*. The meme consists of the four words below:

* *Wenomachainsama*: When I met you in the summer
* *Tumajarbisaun*: To my heartbeat sound
* *Wifenlooof*: We fell in love
* *Eselifterbraun*: As the leaves turned brown

This blogpost, as the title implies, is focused on the second line: *tumajarbisaun*. It struck me as odd that, while the meme spread in English-speaking communities, everyone seemed to accept the *j* to represent the \[h\] sound. Why would an English speaker use *j* for that?

As it turned out, [one trip to Know Your Meme later](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wenomechainsama/videos), the meme originated from Spanish-speaking Instagram user `dank.__.growlithe`. So of course *j* was \[h\], and then the meme spread to English-speaking communities.[^3]

Therefore, the meme is actually an English-to-Spanish-phonetic mondegreen; in fact, we can break down the exact phonetic transitions. Let's do it!

1. To my heartbeat sound (English) 
2. ≈ \[tumahaːrtbiːtsound\] 
3. → \[tumahaːrbiːsoun\] (remove word-final stops)
4. ≈ Tumajarbisaun (Spanish)

There we go; a "real-world" use for linguistics, or something. But I just found this kind of cool that I could almost reconstruct the history of the meme through the phonetics of a nonsense word(!).

[^1]: Does capitalizing YouTube as YouTube make me seem old? Do people just say Youtube now? Oops.

[^2]: Deliberately, as opposed to accidentally.

[^3]: I'm actually surprised most English speakers accepted that *j* just makes the \[h\] sound. But maybe people don't care and it's just a meme.
